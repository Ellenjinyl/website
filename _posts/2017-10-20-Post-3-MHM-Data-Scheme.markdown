Welcome to the third post from the MHM Musketeers group! So if you’ve been following along since post 1, you’ve seen that it was a long journey, but we have finally reached our new project focus—to address the lack of data concerning menstrual hygiene management.

Now let us walk you through our scheme.

So, why is there such a lack of data, anyways? Here are some of the main reasons:Taboos & culture of silence aka no one wants to talk about periodsMHM is a low priority issue for decision makersLack of research in all dimensions related to MHM [education, health, environment, empowerment, economic]No consensus on what good MHM is

Because of the lack of data, there is little coordination and unified action by actors such as governments and NGOs involved in MHM.

In our opinion, with more MHM data we can have greater coordinated action through policy making and advocacy and women will be better informed on how to manage their MHM.

So what data should be collected? Our brainstorming ideas:HealthInfections related to MHMMHM product care—how are girls and women using and caring for their products currently?

EmpowermentSexual violence incidents related to menarche, menstruation and MHMChild marriage incidents related to menarche and menstruation

EconomicMissed work days and related salary lossWork productivity loss

AccessAccess to products (cost, availability, knowledge of product location, money distribution in family)Access to facilities (separate and private toilets, clean water, soap, safe, waste disposal, distance from home)

The conclusion: we will focus on collecting data concerning access to MHM products and facilities.

How? Well that’s for another post. See you next time!

All our bleeding love,

The MHM Musketeers
