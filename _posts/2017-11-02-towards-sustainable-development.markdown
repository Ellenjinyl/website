With Eurasia falling under certain latitudes, it has allowed greater opportunities in terms of agriculture and cattle production. This allowed some empires to flourish such as the rice, cotton, tea productions in terms of trades. Furthermore, industrialization brought a shift in the mode of productions and improvements in standards of living such as wealth, health, assets but it also accelerated environmental impacts.

Global changes:
1)	Systemic eg climate change, CFCs
2)	Cumulative eg overfishing, deforestation

We also did a few mathematical calculations and visual representations of Global temperatures, HDI, the artic sea melt and the drivers of climate change. The graphs represented represented an increasing environmental impact through natural and human forces.
